 		<td style="background-color:#fbeed0"><div style="text-align:center"><h4>Puspins, also known as Pinoy cats or Pusang Pinoy, are cats of no particular breed. They have short coats in a variety of color combinations. Puspins are most commonly referred to as Domestic Short Hair (DSH), House Cat Shorthair (HCS), Shorthair Household Pet, or warmly, a moggy, internationally. Puspin's tail may be standard length although it may also be shorter, "stumpy," or "kinked." Due to the genetic makeup of the cat, this is a frequent trait among many Domestic Short Haired cats in Asia, including Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, and Indonesia. Pictured is my 1 yo Puspin, Badugdug. He is bestest boy :3<li><a href="https://iroislandrescue.org/look-beyond-the-breed-adopt-an-aspin-or-puspin/">Interested in Puspins?</a></h4></td>

 		<td style="background-color:#f3c172";><div style="text-align:center"><h4>Sphynx cats differ in their degree of hairlessness, with some having a very fine "peach fuzz" all over and others having just a fine fuzz over the extremities. Their lack of fur is still the most noticeable trait of this striking cat. The lack of fur allows everyone to clearly see the Sphynx cat's bone structure and muscle. This cat is remarkably robust, with long, graceful lines and somewhat loose skin that develops wrinkles in some spots. They have a tail that is rather long, neat, rounded paws, and a head that is slightly wedge-shaped with enormous eyes and ears.<li><a href="https://www.purina.co.uk/find-a-pet/cat-breeds/sphynx">Interested in Sphynxes?</a></h4></td>

 		<td><div style="text-align:center"><h4>Exotic Shorthair</h4></td>
 		<td style="background-color:#9c795b";><div style="text-align:center"><h4>Exotic shorthair cats are a medium-sized breed with lovely round heads, eyes, and bodies. The majority will weigh between 10 and 12 pounds. Compared to their long-haired relatives, exotic shorthairs are a quiet, inquisitive breed that is slightly more active. Exotic shorthairs are known for their velvety, dense coats even though they are Persian cats' near relatives. However, they share the same round heads and flat faces as Persians. White, blue, black, red, and lilac are just a few of the many hues and patterns that exotic shorthairs come in. Depending on the animal's coat color, their eyes might be blue, blue-green, or copper in hue. Exotic shorthair cats have huge paws, short, thick tails, and a short, sturdy build, similar to Persians.<li><a href="https://www.dailypaws.com/cats-kittens/cat-breeds/exotic-shorthair">Interested in Exotic Shorthairs?</a></h4></td>
